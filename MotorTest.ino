/*=========================================== MOTOR TEST ===========================================
  Using three switches, select up to three motors to control with a potentiometer and display 
  the current position (in percent 0-99) on a 7 segment display. Sound a buzzer when motors are 
  too close to max position, indicating that they might be strained.
  
  Use "switch...case" statements to implement system as a finite state maschine.
  Consider Switch 1 to be the LSB and Switch 3 to be the MSB
  Switches = 0x0000, case 0: no motors are selected, potentiometer has no effect, screen displays "00"
  Switches = 0x0001, case 1: Small servo is activated, deactivate other motors, move to position of potentiometer and display on 7 segment
  Switches = 0x0010, case 2: Tall servo is activated, deactivate other motors, move to position of potentiometer and display on 7 segment
  Switches = 0x0011, case 3: Both Small and Tall servos are activated, deactivate other motors, move to position of potentiometer and display on 7 segment



  ------------------------------------------ About PORTD -------------------------------------------
  Port manipulation allows for the simultaneous manipulation of digital pins. It is faster, but less readable and less transferrable.
  Port D controls pins 0-7 with LSB corresponding to pin 0 and MSB corresponding to pin 7.
  
  Controlled by 3 registers:
  -DDRD:  (R/W) Data direction register D which specifies whether the pins are INPUT (default, hi-z) or OUTPUT (low-z). Always set this reg first!
          Write 0 to set as input, write 1 to set as output
          The low level equivalent of pinMode()
  -PORTD: (R/W) Uses internal pull-ups to set the logic state of pins HIGH or LOW. 
          When configured OUTPUT, think of it as setting state HIGH/LOW. When configured INPUT think of it as setting the pull-up.
          Write 0 to set LOW/disable pull-up, write 1 to set HIGH/enable pull-up.
          The low level equivalent of digitalWrite(), see also bitWrite()
  -PIND:  (R) Reads the state of input pins
          The low level equivalent of digitalRead()
  
  NOTE: PORT D Digital pins 0 and 1 are used for serial comm and programming Arduino. Avoid using these!!!
        For digital pins 8-13 see PORT B, bits 6 and 7 map to the crystal and are unusable. 
        For analog pins 0-5 see PORT C, bits 6 and 7 are only accessible on Arduino mini.

  ---------------------------------------- About Servos --------------------------------------------
  Standard hobbyist servos achieve approximately 180 degrees of motion unless specifically stated.
  They typically expect to see a pulse every 20ms (50Hz period) for historical reasons.
  However modern servos are not defined by the PWM duty cycle, but instead the width of the pulse
  As long as the refresh rate is somewhere between 40Hz-200Hz, the servo should be able to detect, say, a 1ms pulse the same.
  (See Wikipedia: Servo Control)
    1ms pulse -> 0 degrees
    1.5ms pulse -> 90 degrees
    2ms pulse -> 180 degrees

  ------------------------------------- About Motor Shield V1.2-------------------------------------
  "SER1" header -> PWM1B -> Controlled by Uno Pin 10
  "SERVO_2" header -> PWM1A -> Controlled Uno Pin 9
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  -------------------------------- Non-blocking Polling Algorithm ----------------------------------
  Delay() is a blocking process which doesn't allow for any other processing while it waits.
  Instead, poll output every x ms and in between, do whatever other processing you need.
  1. Get the current time in ms
  2. Subtract the time it was last polled to get the elapsed time
  3. Is the elapsed time >= the polling interval?
  4. If so, then poll output
  5. Otherwise, skip it and do something else.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  ------------------------------------------- TO DO ------------------------------------------------
  1. Add LCD using PORTD
  2. Port manipulation of POT (BONUS: replace pot with light sensor)
  3. Port manipulation of Servos
  4. Add alarm for 180 degrees
  5. Implement using interrupts
  6. Add stepper?
